                            Banging your head against a wall for one hour burns 150 calories.
                            
                            If you’re not keen on losing brain cells, you might want to give this calorie-burning idea a miss.
                            
                            A safer way to burn 150 calories would be to take your dog for a walk for 45 minutes.
                       
                    </p>
               
                
                <p class="p">
                    In Switzerland it is illegal to own just one guinea pig.
                    
                    While this may sound like an odd law to try and enforce, it makes perfect sense! Guinea pigs are social animals and easily feel lonely or depressed, which is basically a form of animal cruelty.
                    
                    The real question you should be asking is why this isn’t a law everywhere?!
                </p>

                        The color orange was actually named after oranges.
                        
                        Before oranges arrived in England in the late 15th century, there was no word for the color.
                        
                        It was referred to as ġeolucrog (yellow-saffron), or ġeolurēad (yellow-red) depending on the shade.

                        Snakes can predict earthquakes.
                    
                    
                    
                        Many animals are able to predict earthquakes to varying levels of success. Yet, snakes are the most reliable, sensing earthquakes from as far as 75 miles away (121 km). They can even sense an earthquake five days before it actually occurs!
                        
                        When snakes sense an earthquake, they often leave their nests, even if the temperature is too cold.

                        Crows often hold grudges against specific people.
                        
                        Crows are excellent at recognizing people’s faces and are able to remember people for a long time! This can be either a negative or positive fact, depending on how nice you are to them.
                        
                    
                    While crows can tell us apart, we would find it difficult to distinguish one crow from another.

                <p class="p">
                    7% of American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows.
                    
                    I know that seven percent doesn’t sound like a lot, but it actually works out at 16.4 million American adults. So it’s an alarming fact when you think about it.
                    
                    This shows that one in ten Americans has a flawed understanding of basic science or where their food comes from.

                    During your lifetime, you will produce enough saliva to fill 50 bathtubs!
                    
                    The average person produces roughly one ounce (30 ml) of saliva every hour. That’s 24.3 ounces (720 ml) or one full wine bottle’s worth of saliva a day, which is an average of 69 gallons (263 liters) per year.
                    
                    With the average global life expectancy being about 72 years, this means that you produce an average of 4,968 gallons (18,936 liters) of saliva in your lifetime – enough to fill 50 bathtubs!

<p class="f">
    The most expensive pizza in the world costs $12,000 dollars.
    
    That’s because it takes 72 hours to make, and it can only be made in your home by 3 Italian chefs.
    
    The pizza is topped with 3 types of caviar, bufala mozzarella, lobster from Norway and Cilento, and pink Australian sea salt.
</p>

<p class="f">
    Ranch dressing is dyed.
    
    One ingredient in ranch is titanium dioxide which is used to make it look whiter.
    
    It’s the same ingredient that is used in sunscreen and paint for coloring.
</p>

<p class="f">
    One fast-food burger can have meat from 100 different cows.
    
    It sounds like a crazy amount, but the ground beef used to make burgers, both in fast food places and grocery stores, is made of a collection of muscle tissues.
</p>

<p class="f">
    Crackers have holes in them for a reason.
    
    During the baking process, if the crackers have holes in them, it prevents air bubbles from ruining the product.
    
</p>
<p class="f">
    Ketchup used to be used as a medicine.
    
    Back in the early 1800s, people thought tomatoes had medicinal qualities.
    
    One doctor claimed they could treat diarrhea and indigestion, so he made a recipe for a type of tomato ketchup which then became a pill.
</p>

<p class="f">
    White chocolate isn’t chocolate.
    
    Its name is deceiving because white chocolate doesn’t have any components of regular chocolate.
    
    The red food dye for Skittles is made from boiled beetles.
    
    A common red food dye, carminic acid, is made from the crushed bodies of a beetle called the Dactylopius coccus.
    
    This acid is used in maraschino cherries, strawberry and raspberry flavored candy, and lipstick.
</p>


    <p class="f">
        McDonald’s sells 2.5 billion hamburgers every year.
        
        That equates to 75 McDonald’s hamburgers sold every second, every day, or 6.5 million hamburgers each day!
    </p>
    
    <p class="f">
        Honey is bee vomit.
    
    
    When bees collect nectar, they drink it and keep it in their “stomach.”
    
    Once they’re back at the hive, they regurgitate the nectar into the hive.
    </p>

<p class="f">
    Froot Loops are all the same flavor.
    
    As colorful as they are, you’d think they were flavored accordingly! But no, all Froot Loops are all the same flavor.
</p>

<p class="f">
    Thomas Jefferson made pasta popular in the U.S.
    
    Thomas Jefferson is responsible for bringing the first macaroni machine over to the U.S. after spending time in France.
    
    He was also the one who introduced mac and cheese to Americans!

<h2 id="Spacefacts">Space Facts</h2>

<p class="s">Mercury & Venus are the only 2 planets in our solar system that have no moons.</p>

<p class="s">In total, there are 176 confirmed moons that orbit the planets in our solar system, with some of them being bigger than Mercury itself!</p>

<p class="s">
    If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart.
    
    For 20 years, a team of astronomers observed a star at the center of our galaxy orbiting a black hole.
    
    The star has now got close enough to the black hole for “gravitational redshift” to occur, which is where the star’s light loses energy as the black hole’s gravity intensifies.
</p>

<p class="s">
    Venus is the hottest planet
    
    Most people think that this would be Mercury, as it is the closest planet to the sun.
    
    However, Venus has a lot of gasses in its atmosphere which creates a “Greenhouse Effect” that causes a constant temperature of 864° Fahrenheit (462° Celsius) everywhere on the plant’s surface.
</p>

<p class="s">
    Our solar system is 4.57 billion years old.
    
    Well, give or take 30 million years(ish). Accurately speaking, it is 4.571 billion years old.
    
    Scientists estimate that in about 5 billion years, our Sun will expand becoming a Red Giant.
    
    In about 7.5 billion years its expanding surface will swallow up and engulf the Earth.
</p>
<p class="s">
    
    The highest mountain discovered is the Olympus Mons, which is located on Mars.
    
    Its peak is 16 miles (25 km) high, making it nearly 3 times higher than Mount Everest.
    
    And not only is it tall, but it’s also 374,015 ft² (114,000 m²) wide – that’s an area the size of Arizona!
</p>

<p class="s">
    A light-year is the distance covered by light in a single year.
    
    Light moves at the velocity of about 186,411 miles (300,000 km) a second.
    
    So one light-year equates to roughly 5,903,026,326,255 miles!
</p>

<p class="s">
    The Milky Way galaxy is 105,700 light-years wide.
    
    It would take a modern spacecraft 450,000,000 years to travel to the center of our galaxy!
</p>


   <p class="s">
        The Sun weighs about 330,000 times more than Earth.
        
        It is about 109 times the diameter of Earth and is so large the Earth could fit inside the sun about 1,300,000 times over!
    
    
    In fact, the sun is so gigantic that it contains 99.85% of all mass in our solar system.
   </p>

<p class="s">
    Footprints left on the Moon won’t disappear as there is no wind.
    
    But wait a minute… if there’s no wind to blow them away then why is the flag blowing? Well, it actually wasn’t blowing.
    
    That rippling you see is because of a stubborn telescopic horizontal rod that the astronauts were struggling to remove from the flag’s upper hem.
</p>

<p class="s">
    There are 79 known moons orbiting Jupiter.
    
    Jupiter is the planet in our solar system with the most moons, and it also has the largest moon in our solar system.
    
    That moon is called Ganymede and is 3,270 miles (5,270 km) in diameter – that’s bigger than Mercury and it is visible with just a pair of binoculars!
</p>

<p class="s">
    There are more stars in space than there are grains of sand in the world.
    
    There are 10 times more stars in the night sky than grains of sand on the Earth, with 70 sextillion stars being visible from Earth through a telescope.
    
    To put that in numbers, 70 sextillion is this: 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
