        <h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
    <h2>By <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edgar-allan-poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a></h2>
    
    <p>
        It was many and many a year ago,<br>
        In a kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>,<br>
        That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
        By the name of <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
        Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I was a child and she was a child,<br>
        In this kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>:<br>
        But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
        I and my <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br>
        Coveted her and me.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
        In this kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>,<br>
        A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
        My beautiful <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
        And bore her away from me,<br>
        To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
        In this kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The angels, not half so happy in heaven,<br>
        Went envying her and me—<br>
        Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
        In this kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>)<br>
        That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
        Chilling and killing my <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
        Of those who were older than we—<br>
        Of many far wiser than we—<br>
        And neither the angels in heaven above,<br>
        Nor the demons down under the <span class="sea">sea</span>,<br>
        Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
        Of the beautiful <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br>
        Of the beautiful <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes<br>
        Of the beautiful It was many and many a year ago,<br>
        In a kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>,<br>
        That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
        By the name of <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
        Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I was a child and she was a child,<br>
        In this kingdom by the <span class="sea">sea</span>:<br>
        But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
        I and my <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br>

    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>

        For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br>

        And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes<br>
        Of the beautiful <span class="Annabel">Annabel Lee</span>;<br>
        And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
        Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,<br>
        In her sepulchre there by the <span class="sea">sea</span>—<br>
        In her tomb by the side of the <span class="sea">sea</span>.<br>
