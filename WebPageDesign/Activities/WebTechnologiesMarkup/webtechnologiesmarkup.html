   <h1> HTML</h1>


    <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
        
        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
    </p>
    
    
       <p> <strong>Web development</strong>. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.</p> 
        
       <p> <strong>Internet navigation</strong>. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. </p>
        
       <p> <strong>Web documentation</strong>. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
    
    
   <p>
        It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality, although it is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.

<h1>CSS</h1>

<h2>What Is CSS and How Does It Work?</h2>


<p>    CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather simple reason. HTML element was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.</p>
    
   <p>
        Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of trouble for web developers. Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
        
   </p>
   <p> CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a web page that features only HTML elements as it would look completely bare-boned. CSS allows you to add style to your HTML elements, and it is used to make a web page look more attractive and professional.</p>
    

<h1>JavaScript</h1>


    <p>What Is JavaScript? A Basic Introduction to JS for Beginners</p>
    
   <p>
        JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.
        
   </p>
   <p> It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.</p>
    
   <p> JavaScript’s widespread applications in web, mobile app, and game development make it a valuable language to learn.</p>
